                <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <a href="#">website</a> for the <a
                    href="#">Internet</a> (<a href="#">World Wide Web</a>) or an
                <a href="#">intranet</a> (a private network).<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Web development can range
                from
                developing a simple <a href="#">single static</a> page of
                <a href="#">plain text</a> to complex <a href="#">web applications</a>, <a href="#">electronic
                    businesses</a>, and <a href="#">social network services</a>. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include <a href="#">Web
                    engineering</a>, <a href="#">Web
                    design</a>, <a href="#">Web content development</a>, client liaison, <a
                    href="#">client-side/server-side
                    scripting</a>, <a href="#">Web server</a> and <a href="#">network
                    security</a> configuration, and <a href="#">e-commerce</a> development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing <a href="#">markup</a> and <a href="#">coding.<sup>[2]</sup></a> Web development may use
                <a href="#">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a
                    href="#">Web
                    developers</a>) and follow standard methods like <a href="#">Agile methodologies</a> while
                developing
                Web sites.<a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a <a href="#">graphic designer</a> or <a href="#">information systems</a>
                technician. Web development may be a
                collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are
                three
                kinds of Web developer specialization: <a href="#">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer, and
                full-stack developer.<a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
                Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while
                back-end
                developers deal with the servers.<a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Since the commercialization of the Web,
                the
                industry has boomed and has
                become one of the most used technologies ever.

                <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs
                    of
                    academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <a
                        href="#">HTML</a>
                    was developed in
                    1993.<a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
                <p>Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small
                    amount
                    of information.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="#">HTTP</a>,
                    HTML and <a href="#">URI</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

                    O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing
                    interactivity.<a href="#"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
                <p>Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only
                    nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often
                    referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
                <p>In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing
                    activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies.<a href="#"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The
                    architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized <a
                        href="#">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from
                    independent platforms and <a href="#">online databases</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

                <h2>Web 3.0</h2>
                <p>Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept
                    envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of <a
                        href="#">metadata</a>, precise information delivery, and improved <a href="#">user
                        experiences</a> based on preferences, history, and interests.<a href="#"><sup>[citation
                            needed]</sup></a></p>
                <p>Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than
                    traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core
                    ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user
                    profiles.<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

                <p>The journey of web development technologies began with simple <a href="#">HTML</a> pages in the early
                    days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of <a href="#">CSS</a> for
                    styling and <a href="#">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites
                    into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web
                    applications we have today.</p>
